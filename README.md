Markus is an online grading and assignment submission platform made in house by UofT professors and used in several universities. I've used it many times myself. 

From January 2022 to August 2022, and from September 2023 to December 2023.

Memory Viz - Memory Model Diagrams

<code><a href="https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ATheTallJerry+user%3Adavid-yz-liu">My Pull Requests (PRs)</a></code>

MemoryViz generates memory model diagrams for Python code in the style of CSC110/111/148 at the University of Toronto. 

From January 2024 to April 2024.

These open source work were undertaken in the form of volunteering, alongside other students, under the supervision of Professor David Liu. I see open source contributions as an inexpensive way of giving back to the community :) and also a ton of fun!
